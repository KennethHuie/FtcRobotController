**Oakland Technical High School Robotics Club - FTC Team #24381**

Welcome to the official page of **Oakland Technical High School Robotics Club**, home of **FTC Team Cyberdogz #24381**!

Founded in **2023**, our team is made up of a small but passionate group of about **15 dedicated members** who are committed to pushing the limits of technology and robotics. As part of the **FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC)**, we tackle real-world engineering challenges, design and build robots, and engage in friendly competition with other teams from around the world.

While our team is small, our enthusiasm and drive are mighty. We believe in fostering collaboration, creativity, and problem-solving through hands-on learning and teamwork. Whether it's coding, designing, or building, every member of our team plays a vital role in the journey from idea to competition-ready robot.

We're excited to be part of the vibrant Oakland Technical High School community and look forward to sharing our progress as we continue to grow and improve in the FTC competition.
